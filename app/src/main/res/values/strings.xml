    <string name="app_description">\t Feel free to browse through four examples.\n\t If you have any
        suggestions, for example idea of one more example, please, rise an issue in GitHub.\n\t
        All presenters lifecycle methods are logged. Each presenter has random id, to help
        you identify this presenter in logs.\n\t
        I recommend you to enable "Don't keep activities". So you can easily see when presenters are destoyed.\n\t
        Btw, this activity doesn\'t retain presenter on purpose, check it out!</string>
